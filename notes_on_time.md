To lose streak, BOTH:
- UTC > 47 hours (1 hour leeway)
- user's calendar day > 1

1st Jan 2300
2nd Jan 0600 - 7 hours later
2nd Jan 2300 - 24 hours later


Why?
Checkin A, 1st Jan 0600
Checkin B, 2nd Jan 2000, 34 hours later, still 1 'day'

Checkin A, 1st Jan 0100
Checkin B, 2nd Jan 2300, 45 hours later, still 1 calendar

possibility of jumping 2 calendar days in 36 hours?
1st Jan UTC +8 1 -> -7
1st Jan UTC -8 23 -> 32
= 39 hours

1st Jan UTC  1 -4 UTC -> 21 on 31st Dec
1st Jan UTC 22 +4 UTC ->  2 on 2nd Jan
21 hours later we have a 2 calendar day difference.
